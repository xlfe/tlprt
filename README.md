Almost everyone benefits from a shorter transit

# xlfe/tlprt

A clojure/script library to take a string/byte-array/clojure object and encode it (via transit and zlib) into a 
string that is safe to use as a DOM identifier or a URI.

You can encode in the JVM and get the same data back after decoding in the browser (hopefully!)
